This directory contains 3 Python examples of a simple 2D heat equation solver

These examples were adapted from https://github.com/jfavre/InSitu-Vis-Tutorial2022

### Basic version runs without in-situ coupling and writes images using matplotlib
heat_diffusion_basic.py

### Ascent version runs in parallel, with an in-situ coupling with Ascent
heat_diffusion_insitu_parallel_ascent.py

### Catalyst version runs in parallel, with an in-situ coupling with Catalyst
heat_diffusion_insitu_parallel_catalyst.py
