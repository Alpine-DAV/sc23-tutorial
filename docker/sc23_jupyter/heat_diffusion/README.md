This directory contains 3 Python examples of a simple 2D heat equation solver

These examples were adapted from https://github.com/jfavre/InSitu-Vis-Tutorial2022

### A basic version that runs without in-situ coupling and plots state using matplotlib
heat_diffusion_basic.ipynb

### An Ascent version that runs in parallel, with an in-situ coupling with Ascent
heat_diffusion_insitu_parallel_ascent.py

### A Catalyst version that runs in parallel, with an in-situ coupling with Catalyst
heat_diffusion_insitu_parallel_catalyst.py
